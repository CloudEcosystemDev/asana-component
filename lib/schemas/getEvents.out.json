For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B\nmodified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events\nare generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API\nconsumers should make sure to handle this case.\n\nThe `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one\nthat the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For\nexample, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks\ncontained within the project.\n\n**Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields\n`Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.\n`Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource\nitself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information\nwithin the resource's fields have been modified.\n\nFor instance, consider these scenarios:\n\n\n* When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be\n`added`, `Event.parent` will be on object with the `id` and\n`type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.\n\n\n* When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be\n`null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,\n`Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `changed_value` will\nbe an object with the user's `id` and `type`.\n\n\n* When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will\nbe `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,\n`Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be\nan object with the user's `id` and `type`.",
